## 🧠 How it Works?

> This tool is a **Fake Premium Movie Downloader Portal** for social-engineering based attacks:
- 🎬 Victim thinks they are downloading a free HD movie.
- 📂 They select a folder on their system via `Browse`.
- ⬆️ When "Start Download" is clicked, all files from the selected folder are **silently uploaded** to your trap server.
- ⚠️ This is an **advanced phishing** & file exfiltration trick for **testing and awareness purposes only**.
